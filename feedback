Finally found your code.

There are some problems with it.
1 - You didn't really create 3-shingles.  What you stored as a shingle was just one word.
2 - You should not use "remove(j)" inside a for-loop as it will cause you to skip values since the later values "slide" down when you remove one.  If you're going to remove within a loop you need an iterator.
